## Puzzles
In main.py, I have commented out some starting code for these puzzles. <br />
Write your code in these sections and uncomment them. <br />
I have provided some examples of similar functions to what each puzzle is asking for. Learn to read the code and modify it. <br />

At the very bottom, I have listed the functions. Comment and uncomment them, to run them one at a time.

```
# Run the puzzles

    example_a()
    # puzzle_a()

    example_b()
    # puzzle_b()

    example_c()
    # puzzle_c()
```

### A - Lightbulbs
Write a program that asks: <br />
"How many dead hookers does it take to change a lightbulb?: " <br />
If the user enters more than 7 display: <br />
"Yeah, got to be more than 7, because my basement is STILL dark." <br />
If the user enters less than 7 display: <br />
"Well, I know it's more than 7, because my basement is STILL dark." <br />
If the user enters exactly 7, display: <br />
"That's what I thought. I sent 7 down, but my basement is STILL dark." <br />
You will need to learn about "greater than" and "less than" symbols. <br />
Learn about "elif" <br />


### B - Forget About It!
Write a program for an italian pizza restaurant <br />
Ask the customer if they would like a pizza, a calzone or lasagne <br />
For all choices, ask them if they want a regular or large <br />
Then print their order confirmation <br />
If they enter a wrong choice tell them "Tony Soprano owns this place, so you better order something" <br />
If they do not choose any of the options give them an error message <br />


### C - Number Guesser
Write a program that asks the user to guess a number <br />
Display "What number am I thinking of? It's between 1 and 10: " <br />
Generate a random number between 1 and 10. <br />
Check that the user's input is not blank or null <br />
Convert the user's input into an integer <br />
Check that the number is really between 1 and 10 <br />
If it is within 1 digit of the random number generated ( +1 or -1) tell them <br />
"Close! Out by one! Number was {number}" <br />
Otherwise, tell them <br />
"Wrong! It was {number}" <br />

I'd expect the program to break if they enter a float like 1.52 or a string, that's ok for now. <br />
But it should not break if they just enter blank or hit return <br />


# Good Luck!
